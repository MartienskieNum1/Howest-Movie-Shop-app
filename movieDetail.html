                                    him the story of a farmboy-turned-pirate who encounters numerous obstacles, enemies
                                    and allies in his quest to be reunited with his true love.::Movie Guy&quot;&quot;,
                                    &#x27;An elderly man reads the book &quot;&quot;The Princess Bride&quot;&quot; to
                                    his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book
                                    which has been passed down within the family for generations. The grandson is sure
                                    he won\&#x27;t like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something
                                    with lots of action and &quot;&quot;no kissing&quot;&quot;. But the grandson is
                                    powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn\&#x27;t want to hurt. The
                                    story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess
                                    bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still
                                    laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired
                                    hand on the farm, his stock answer of &quot;&quot;as you wish&quot;&quot; to any
                                    request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he
                                    loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate
                                    Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage,
                                    Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his
                                    two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named
                                    Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman.
                                    They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is
                                    the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives
                                    is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see
                                    other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within
                                    the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it
                                    proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as
                                    action.::Huggo&#x27;, &quot;&quot;A kindly grandfather sits down with his ill
                                    grandson and reads him a story. The story is one that has been passed down from
                                    father to son for generations. As the grandfather reads the story, the action comes
                                    alive. The story is a classic tale of love and adventure as the beautiful Buttercup,
                                    engaged to the odious Prince Humperdinck, is kidnapped and held against her will in
                                    order to start a war, It is up to Westley (her childhood beau, now returned as the
                                    Dread Pirate Roberts) to save her. On the way he meets a thief and his hired
                                    helpers, an accomplished swordsman and a huge, super strong giant, both of whom
                                    become Westley&#x27;s companions in his quest.::Afterburner
                                    &lt;aburner@erols.com&gt;&quot;&quot;, &#x27;When the lovely Buttercup is kidnapped
                                    by a ghastly gang intent on fomenting an international incident they find they are
                                    pursued by the Dread Pirate Roberts who just might be Westley, her one true love.
                                    Also after everyone is nasty Prince Humperdinck to whom Buttercup is now betrothed
                                    but who seems to care little for her continued survival. The stage is set for
                                    swordfights, monsters, and tortures - but will Grandpa be allowed to finish telling
                                    the story with all these kissy bits?::Jeremy Perkins {J-26}&#x27;,
                                    &quot;&quot;Return to a time when men and swamps were swamps. Fire Swamps, that is.
                                    Full of quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size. Lagoons were inhabited by shrieking
                                    eels. And the most beautiful woman in the world was named . . . Buttercup? Well,
                                    it&#x27;s a bent fairy tale. Complete with all the fencing, chasing, escapes, and
                                    silly accents you&#x27;d expect. Including such unique folk as Inigo Montoya, who
                                    has dreamed his whole life of finding the six-fingered man who killed his father.
                                    Fezzik is his enormous sidekick. And Max is the kvetching miracle man. Blonde
                                    Buttercup loves Westley, a poor stable boy. But when he&#x27;s captured by pirates,
                                    she&#x27;s chosen by evil Prince Humperdinck to be his princess bride. Along the
                                    way, she gets kidnapped, he gets killed. But it all ends up okay.::Robert Lynch
                                    &lt;docrlynch@yahoo.com&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;When a young boy falls ill, his
                                    grandfather pops round to visit him. To cheer his grandson up, Grandpa has brought a
                                    storybook; The Princess Bride, a tale of the love between the beautiful Buttercup
                                    and the besotted Westley, a love cruelly interrupted by Westley&#x27;s tragic
                                    apparent death at sea when seeking his fortune. Heartbroken, Buttercup has sworn
                                    never to love again, but accepts the marriage proposal of the rich and handsome
                                    Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin; but death is no barrier to true
                                    love, and in a story filled with exotically-accented swordsmen, big-hearted giants,
                                    genius kidnappers, sadistic torturers, vile swamps, Rodents of Unusual Size, the
                                    Dread Pirate Roberts and a somewhat embittered miracle worker, the love between
                                    Westley and Buttercup twists and turns on a path filled with adventure. Will the
                                    True Love of Westley and Buttercup win the day? Will Inigo Montaya find the
                                    six-fingered man who murdered his father? Will Humperdinck&#x27;s evil plans come to
                                    fruition? And, more importantly, will Grandpa be able to tell the story without any
                                    of the yucky kissing?::Scott Nisbet&quot;&quot;]</strong></span></p>
